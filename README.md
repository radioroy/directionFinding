# Software for “Designing and Testing an Ad Hoc Phased Array Antenna Network for Search and Rescue (Physical Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering)” - 092-E70-F1

# Arduino code, used to control the antena switcher is written in C and was entirely written by me.
# Arduino:
# DF_tester_1.ino
# DF_tester_2.ino
# DF_tester_3.ino
# DF_tester_4.ino
# DF_tester_5.ino
# DF_tester_6.ino
# DF_tester_7.ino
# DF_tone_test.ino

# Raspberry Pi code is used to process the output from the SDR and calculates the signal bearing is written in Python. I developed this algorithm using a spreadsheet, and I had help porting it to Python.
